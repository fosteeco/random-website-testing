# Random Website stuff

Right now this has a form example in it and a javascript list example that I was learning on treehouse. I like to brush up on some skills every now and then and this is the project that I do that on.

There is also some music notes under the form that I created with [CSS battles](https://cssbattle.dev/). If you've never seen that website it is worth checking out because it can be a lot of fun.
